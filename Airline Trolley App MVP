Airline Trolley App

Goal: Develop a system for tracking orders onboard a plane.  This app is for air stewards and not for customers

MVP

Stewards will use the app to select items from the stock and create a bill for the transaction.

Orders will be simple and only include items from the menu (like:  1 * Coffee, 1 * Scone, 2 * Diet Coke)

Orders should be assigned to a seat. 

Stewards can mark the transaction as paid and record which payment type is used.

There will be a running total for what has been sold throughout the shift to manage money and stock replenishment for next flight.
